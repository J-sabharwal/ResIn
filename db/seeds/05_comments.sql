VALUES (1, 2,'Jonas takes great care to really explain how things work under the hood, so you don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re just copying codeâ€”you&rsquo;re actually understanding what you&rsquo;re writing, and why. In particular, I appreciate that Jonas doesn&rsquo;t edit out the little missteps along the way. Instead, he uses each one as a chance to show students how to problem-solve like a developer: what to type into Google when you&rsquo;re stuck, how to get to the bottom of an error message, etc.');
